original inspirations -- [@mcytmotivations](https://twitter.com/mcytmotivations) [@PrskAnything](https://twitter.com/PrskAnything) [@r1999_anything](https://twitter.com/r1999_anything)

shoutouts -- [@PMAnythingBot](https://twitter.com/PMAnythingBot) as most of the code for this bot was taken from their repository with some or maybe a handful of tweaking from me. and also an even bigger shoutout to [@WhiteRoseBot](https://twitter.com/WhiteRoseBot) for the tutorial for dummies like me ( repositories : [WhiteRoseBot](https://github.com/litvanika/whiterose_bot) / [PMAnythingBot](https://github.com/MonoScyron/PM-anything-bot) )
