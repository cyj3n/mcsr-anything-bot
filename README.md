shoutouts -- [@PMAnythingBot](https://twitter.com/PMAnythingBot) as most of the code for this bot was taken from their repository with some or maybe a handful of tweaking from me. and also an even bigger shoutout to [@WhiteRoseBot](https://twitter.com/WhiteRoseBot) for the tutorial for dummies like me

this was a stupid idea btw i hadn't coded with python since i was like 12.

(surprisingly finished the code in like two days, but i didn't understand a thing. basically: i did not know what i was doing while making this.)
