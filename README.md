[@mcsranything](https://twitter.com/mcsranything) : a silly twitter bot that posts random runners (and mcsr adjacent people) in different situations !

shoutout to [@WhiteRoseBot](https://twitter.com/WhiteRoseBot) and [@PMAnythingBot](https://twitter.com/PMAnythingBot) as most of the code in this repo was taken from their repositories ([WhiteRoseBot](https://github.com/litvanika/whiterose_bot) / [PMAnythingBot](https://github.com/MonoScyron/PM-anything-bot) ) with some or maybe a bit of tweaking from me

this was a stupid idea btw i hadn't coded with python since i was like 12.
i did not know what i was doing.
